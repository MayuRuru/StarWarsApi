## Consuming the StarWars API

🌌 Application to display different endpoints from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/api).

### Summary:
* I am not so fan of Pokemons really, but wanted to play some more with APIs... 
* This is a funny gift to my mother, who made me a fan of Star Wars movies (the old ones, of course!!).
* I started with a fake api and turned into consuming the Star Wars API.
* I've been practising plain CSS with module.css for this project.
**Next steps:** refactor code and toggle from people to planets data.

## ⚒️ Tech Stack & Tools:
* HTML + CSS + JavaScript
* CSS MODULES
* REACT JS
* Axios
* React-Router-Dom

## 📌 Still in process but you can check it out:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MayuRuru/PokemonApi.git
npm install
npm start
```
* Runs the app in the development mode | Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
* Careful with your speakers if you have not autoplay disabled 😅
